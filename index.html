                <p>finding effects and implementing them. I think I am very good at creating single pieces, but
                    sometimes find it challenging to create a hole website with one common line / style, and this is

                    Arts and Crafts Movement, and she was also an artist in the movement. I uses brushes that had a
                    similar pattern to William Morris wallpapers to create the effect on the layer mask.

                <p>These photos was made for a jewelerâ€™s website. I took the photographs and made sure to have a low
                    depth of field to have focus on the actual earrings. The photos was made so they could be used on
                    the website as they were, but we decided to go with the watercolor effect. I made the effect in
                    Photoshop. The watercolours was used as splash images on the website of the jeweler, the aim was to
                    have a romantic feeling, of the earrings and at the same time have a realistic sense of what the
                    earrings look like.

                    style was all up to me. I wanted to keep the style simple and fun. That is why I choose very bright
                    colours. The woman is the villain in the story, so I made her features triangled and pointy, the
                    dog and the bird at the heros and are therefore more round and fluffy. It is meant to be a fun game
                    for kids at the age of 8-12.
