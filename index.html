                <h3>Hard to live without</h3>
                <p>As a case project on 2. semester, we made a campaign for Alm. Brand insurance company. As part of
                    the
                    campaign we made a commercial for the insurance product Yndlings. From the 36 videos that our class
                    had
                    made, Alm. Brand selected 5 that they deemed the best for their product, and posted them on
                    facebook
                    for 1 week each, to see which would get the best results. Our video won the competition with these
                    stats:</p>

                    have an influence by attending demonstrations. We contacted the organizers and the got in touch
                    with
                    Allan, and wee decided that he was a good subject.

                    recording I
                    interviewed him. I also did some camera work at the demonstration, where all the close-up and semi
                    close-ups are recorded by me. I edited the title sequence. The storyboard, interview guide and the
                    editing was done as a group project.</p>

                <h3>Splash</h3>
                <p>At 1. semester at the multimedia designer education on KEA I made a website about the Arts and
                    Crafts
                    Movement. This splash image was created for the site. Since The Arts and Crafts Movement was
                    prominent
                    in the late 19th / early 20th century, I wanted to communicate the style of the time, but also
                    update
                    it and try to make it relevant for today. The image is made in Photoshop, the lady is May Morris,
                    daughter of William Morris, the founder of the movement, and she was also an artist in the
                    movement. I
                    uses brushes that had a similar pattern to William Morris wallpapers to create the effect on the
                    overlay. </p>

                <p>These photos was made for a jewelerâ€™s website. I took the photographs and made sure to have a low
                    depth
                    of field to have focus on the actual earrings. I made the watercolour effect in Photoshop. The
                    watercolours was used as splash images on the website of the jeweler, the aim was to have a
                    romantic
                    feeling, of the earrings and at the same time have a realistic sense of what the earrings look
                    like.

                    I have made a slider, to compare the two images, the watercolours have been cropped a little.</p>

                <p>This animation was 1.semester project on the multimedia design education at KEA. The structure of
                    the
                    animation was set, but the story and style was all up to me. I wanted to keep the style simple and
                    fun.
                    That is why I choose very bright colours. The woman is the villain in the story, so I made her
                    features
                    triangled and pointy, the dog and the bird at the heros and are therefore more round and fluffy. It
                    is
                    made to be a fun game for kids at the age of 8-12.
